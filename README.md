- <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29e970cd-e8b7-4125-b0f1-a2144b40d7f9" /> Google auto contact sync feature is not working so you have to manually import your contacts.
- Some apps cannot log in using <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29e970cd-e8b7-4125-b0f1-a2144b40d7f9" /> Google account.
- Apparently, <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c26d48f2-492a-49a8-8c38-895ed19f4ffa" /> Snapchat detects that you are using <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2acef641-cfdf-4dcd-a5d8-be0eba79d567" /> MicroG so it does not let you use <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c26d48f2-492a-49a8-8c38-895ed19f4ffa" /> Snapchat filters by blinking the <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c26d48f2-492a-49a8-8c38-895ed19f4ffa" /> Snapchat camera when you want to use filters.

## Post-Installation Steps
- First thing you should do is enter `Self-Check` section and enable all the options you can.
  - **GSF**, **find accounts** and **work profile** options might not be able to be enabled. You do not have to worry about it as long as you are able to enable other options.
- Next, go to `Google Accounts` and add your <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29e970cd-e8b7-4125-b0f1-a2144b40d7f9" /> Google account.
  - Also, make sure `Trust Google for app permissions`, `Allow apps to find accounts`, and `Authenticate with device registration` options are enabled.
- Then, go back and **enable** `Google device registration`, `Cloud Messaging` and `Google SafetyNet.`
- Lastly, go to `Location` and enable all the options you see.
- After configuring <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2acef641-cfdf-4dcd-a5d8-be0eba79d567" /> MicroG, you should install a <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abd68b9b-79ab-4062-a28c-54edff49e54e" /> **Play Store alternative**. My suggestion is [Aurora Store](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store/), it is an **open source <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abd68b9b-79ab-4062-a28c-54edff49e54e" /> Play Store alternative** and it **does not send any telemetry to <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29e970cd-e8b7-4125-b0f1-a2144b40d7f9" /> Google**.

## Who is MicroG for? <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2acef641-cfdf-4dcd-a5d8-be0eba79d567" />
- <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2acef641-cfdf-4dcd-a5d8-be0eba79d567" /> MicroG is for everyone who wants to **de-google** their lives and **increase privacy against Google** as much as possible.
- If you are using a **stock ROM**, you **cannot** use <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2acef641-cfdf-4dcd-a5d8-be0eba79d567" /> MicroG because stock ROMs already include official Google services and libraries.

  - Also, you should make sure that your custom ROM is supported following [this article](https://github.com/microg/GmsCore/wiki/Signature-Spoofing). Otherwise, <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2acef641-cfdf-4dcd-a5d8-be0eba79d567" /> MicroG **will not work** on your device!
### What are the Benefits of Using MicroG? <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2acef641-cfdf-4dcd-a5d8-be0eba79d567" />
- <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2acef641-cfdf-4dcd-a5d8-be0eba79d567" /> MicroG simply lets you use your Google account and services like **safety net, push notifications, location etc.** with the most privacy possible.

### What are the Disadvantages of Using MicroG?
- Google auto contact sync feature is not working so you have to manually import your contacts.
- Some apps cannot log in using Google account.
- Apparently, Snapchat detects that you are using MicroG so it does not let you use Snapchat filters by blinking the Snapchat camera when you want to use filters. However, you can keep using Snapchat camera without filters.
## Post-Installation Steps
- First thing you should do is enter `Self-Check` section and enable all the options you can.
  - **GSF**, **find accounts** and **work profile** options might not be able to be enabled. You do not have to worry about it as long as you are able to enable other options.
- Next, go to `Google Accounts` and add your Google account.
  - Also, make sure `Trust Google for app permissions`, `Allow apps to find accounts`, and `Authenticate with device registration` options are enabled.
- Then, go back and **enable** `Google device registration`, `Cloud Messaging` and `Google SafetyNet.`
- Lastly, go to `Location` and enable all the options you see.
- After configuring <img width="16" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2acef641-cfdf-4dcd-a5d8-be0eba79d567" /> MicroG, you should install a **Play Store alternative**. My suggestion is [Aurora Store](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store/), it is an **open source Play Store alternative** and it **does not send any telemetry to Google**.
